  - Add Now collection type definitions for topics and growthStage

- [x] **P1.3** Test schema changes with existing Now posts
  - Verify no errors with posts missing topics field

  - Parse MDX content and skip import statements
  - Extract first meaningful sentence from markdown
  - Cap preview text at 100 characters
  - Handle edge cases (empty content, only imports, etc.)

- [x] **P3.2** Test preview extraction with existing Now posts
  - Verify import statements are skipped (like in `2023-06.mdx`)
  - Confirm meaningful content extraction
  - Test character limit functionality

### Phase 4: Garden Page Integration

- [x] **P4.1** Update `src/pages/garden.astro`

  - Add Now collection to `getCollection` calls
  - Include Now posts in `allPosts` array
  - Update page description to mention Now posts

- [x] **P4.2** Update `src/components/search/GardenHits.astro`

  - Add Now post display logic using NowCard component
  - Include Now posts in Post interface type
  - Add data attributes for filtering using `post.data.type` consistently

- [x] **P4.3** Update `src/components/search/GardenFilters.astro`
  - Add "Now Updates" option to types filter dropdown
  - Ensure filtering logic works with Now posts

### Phase 5: Topic System Integration

- [ ] **P5.1** Update `src/utils/getTopics.ts`

  - Include Now collection in `getAllTopics` function
  - Include Now collection in `getPostsForTopic` function
  - Handle optional topics field gracefully

- [ ] **P5.2** Update `src/pages/topics/[topic].astro`

  - Add Now posts to Post type union
  - Add NowCard display logic in the mapping function
  - Update page description to mention Now posts

- [ ] **P5.3** Test topic filtering with Now posts
  - Verify Now posts appear on relevant topic pages
  - Confirm posts without topics are excluded from topic pages
  - Test sorting by date works correctly

### Phase 6: Testing and Validation

- [ ] **P6.1** Comprehensive testing

  - Test garden page displays Now posts correctly
  - Test topic pages include Now posts when relevant
  - Test filtering and sorting functionality
  - Verify no errors with existing Now posts lacking topics

- [ ] **P6.2** Performance and UI validation
  - Ensure page load times remain acceptable
  - Verify card layout works across device sizes
  - Test with various content lengths and edge cases

## Technical Considerations

### Content Preview Extraction Strategy

- Skip import statements at the top of MDX files
- Parse markdown to extract plain text (strip formatting)
- Find first complete sentence or first 100 characters
- Handle edge cases like files with only imports or very short content

### Schema Backwards Compatibility

- Make `topics` field optional to avoid breaking existing Now posts
- Default `growthStage` to "evergreen" for all Now posts
- Ensure filtering works correctly with undefined/empty topics

### Performance Impact

- Adding Now posts to garden page will increase initial data load
- Consider if additional posts require pagination or lazy loading
- Monitor build times with additional content processing

## Files to be Modified/Created

### New Files

- `planning/now-posts-garden-integration.md` (this file)
- `src/components/cards/NowCard.astro`
- `src/utils/extractPreview.ts`

### Modified Files

- `src/content/config.ts`

  - Handles edge cases (empty content, files with only imports, etc.)

- **P3.2** ✅ Created test page `src/pages/test-preview-extraction.astro`
