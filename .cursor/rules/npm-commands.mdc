# NPM Commands Restrictions

Guidelines for recommending npm commands in this project.

<rule>
name: npm-commands-restrictions
description: Restrict Cursor from suggesting or running npm scripts

filters:
  - type: content
    pattern: "npm run|npm start|npm build|cd.*npm"

actions:
  - type: reject
    conditions:
      - pattern: "npm run dev|npm run start|npm run build|npm start|npm build|cd.*npm run|cd.*&&.*npm"
        message: "Do not suggest running npm scripts. The developer uses an external terminal to manage the dev server."

  - type: suggest
    message: |
      IMPORTANT RESTRICTION: Never suggest or attempt to run the development server.
      
      1. NEVER suggest any of these:
         - npm run dev
         - npm run start
         - npm start
         - npm run build
         - npm build
         - cd /path/to/project && npm run dev
         - Any command that navigates to the project directory and runs an npm script
         - Any command that starts or builds the application
         
      2. ONLY suggest:
         - npm install <package>
         - npm install --save-dev <package>
         - npm uninstall <package>
         
      3. The developer EXCLUSIVELY uses a separate terminal window to:
         - Start the development server
         - Build the application
         - Stop the application
         - Run any npm scripts
         
      4. NEVER attempt to test implementations by running the development server.
      
      5. Instead of suggesting to run the server, say "You can test this implementation in your external development server."

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: Suggesting to run dev server
      "Let's test the implementation by running the development server:
      cd /Users/helios/Github/maggieappleton.com-V3 && npm run dev"
      
      # Bad: Suggesting to start the app
      "To see these changes, start the application with npm run dev"
      
      # Good: Suggesting to test in external server
      "You can test this implementation in your external development server."
      
      # Good: Suggesting to install dependencies
      "To install the required dependencies, run: npm install react-markdown"
    output: "Never suggest running the app, only suggest npm install commands"
