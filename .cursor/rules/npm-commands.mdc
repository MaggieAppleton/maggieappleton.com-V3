# NPM Commands Restrictions

Guidelines for recommending npm commands in this project.

<rule>
name: npm-commands-restrictions
description: Restrict Cursor from suggesting npm run commands

filters:
  - type: content
    pattern: "npm run|npm start|npm build"

actions:
  - type: reject
    conditions:
      - pattern: "npm run dev|npm run start|npm run build|npm start|npm build"
        message: "Do not suggest running npm scripts. The developer uses an external terminal to manage the dev server."

  - type: suggest
    message: |
      When working with npm in this project:
      
      1. DO suggest:
         - npm install <package>
         - npm install --save-dev <package>
         - npm uninstall <package>
         
      2. DO NOT suggest:
         - npm run dev
         - npm run start
         - npm start
         - npm run build
         - npm build
         - Any other npm commands that start or build the application
         
      3. The developer uses a terminal outside of Cursor to manage the development server.

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: Suggesting to run dev server
      "To start the development server, run: npm run dev"
      
      # Good: Suggesting to install dependencies
      "To install the required dependencies, run: npm install"
    output: "Only suggest npm install commands, never npm run commands"
