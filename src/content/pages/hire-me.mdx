## Intro

Hello! I'm Maggie Appleton, a designer-developer-anthropologist hybrid looking for my next role. Officially, I'm either a **product designer** or **design engineer** depending on how you define those roles within your company. I specialise in designing and building interfaces for language models and AI systems, and I'm specifically interested in working on products that leverage these capabilities to solve serious problems in domains like biomedicine, scientific research, education, engineering, and sustainable energy.

I'm on maternity leave from March-August 2025, but I'm looking to start a new role at the beginning of September.

## What I can do

### Primary skills

### Design engineering

- Prototyping possible design solutions in code, not just static mock-ups. I'm best at building zero-to-one prototypes for research and testing.
- Reducing technical risk by validating what's possible and where we run up against the limitations of a medium.
- I work in modern web technologies â€“ primarily React, Vue, and classic HTML/CSS/JS. Including all the classic add-ons to those like Next.js, Nuxt, Tailwind, and TypeScript.
- Basic backends where needed; Supabase, Firebase, or just a local IndexedDB instance usually works.
- Prompt engineering and working with foundation AI models. Into setting up prompt chains, RAG search, and experimenting with the latest techniques to augment experiences with LLMs.
- I can ship front-end production code if needed, but your actual engineers would do a better job of it. My code is fast, hacky, and designed to explore ideas.

### Product design

- Identifying and prioritising user needs by talking to users and dipping into data analytics.
- Exploring a wide range of possible solutions in collaboration with PMs and engineers.
- Validating how well proposed solutions solve the problem through prototyping and user testing.
- Measuring how well design solutions perform after shipping them and iterating to perfect them.

### Secondary skills

### Public speaking and presenting

At some point I started doing conference talks as a way to get free tickets to events I wanted to go to anyway. Over the past few years I've delivered talks to audiences at Beyond Tellerrand, Smashing Conference, React Advanced, UX London, Google, MIT, and many more. This has made me comfortable speaking to large audiences, skilled at creating beautiful and clear presentations, and able to weave together scattered bits of research and data into compelling narratives that hold people's attention for 40+ minutes. This may or may not be useful to you, but happy to deploy these skills as needed.

### Writing and communication

## What I've done before

I've been designing and building digital products for over ten years. I spent the first five years as an illustrator and visual UI designer and the last five in product design and front-end engineering.

All my work has been focused on the web. I've primarily built and designed complex, knowledge-work oriented products.

I don't have much experience designing or building mobile apps or native apps, so I'm probably not a great fit if those are your primary platforms.

## What I'm looking for

### Must haves

### A nice team in London

A team that is either based in London or has at least a few people here. Ideally I'd get to work in person with the team 1-2 days a week. If your team is fully remote, I'm open to hearing from you, but your team needs to be _really damn good_ at remote communication and culture.

After working on many remote teams, I've come to believe solving hard design problems is infinitely harder across long distances and time zone gaps. Everything becomes easier when people are in the room with you, in real time, sketching ideas on whiteboards and scraps of paper, sharing context, building strong bonds, and earning each other's trust.

I'm looking to join a tight-knit team that cares about each other.

### Your company is working on an actual, real, impactful problem

Now, I don't mean to be rude, but this industry has lots of companies trying to solve insignificant or imagined problems.

Here are some things I don't think are real problems:

- Marketers need higher click-through rates on their promotional emails
- Sales people need a faster way to send cold outreach emails
- There aren't enough AI-generated articles on the web
- Crypto bros can't easily manage their investments
- Tech workers find daily chores like grocery shopping, laundry, and cleaning too inconvenient to do themselves

Here are some real problems:

- Drug discovery is complex, costly, and slow
- Medical device approval takes too long
- Early cancer detection methods are inaccurate
- Preventative medicine is underfunded and undervalued
- Writing, publishing, and consuming new scientific research is inefficient
- Quality software engineering is too expensive and concentrated in the hands of the elite
- Urban planning legislation is slow and cumbersome
- We can't build enough affordable housing for everyone
- Industrial engineering projects are usually over budget and late

This is not an exhaustive list. I'm open to working on a wide range of real problems, including domains I've never even heard of. I'm also open to design agencies, consultancies, and investment firms who work with a range of companies, so long as most of them are "real problem" companies.

### Nice to haves

A four day work week. Come September I'll still be adjusting to life as a new parent. I'd prefer to work four days a week, at least for the first few months. I'll expect us to adjust my compensation to reflect the reduced hours.
