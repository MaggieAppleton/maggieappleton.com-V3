<BirthProbability/>

This is the likelihood of spontaneous labour starting on each day of
your pregnancy, based on statistical data from a large sample of pregnancies. Blue bars show the probability of giving birth on that specific day. Purple line shows the cumulative probability of having given birth by that day.

Based on Smith 2001, "Use of time to event analysis to estimate the normal duration of human pregnancy" https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article-abstract/16/7/1497/693431
