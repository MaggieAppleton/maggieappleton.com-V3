## A Generated Web

There's a swirl of optimism around how these models will save us from a suite of boring busywork: writing formal emails, internal memos, technical documentation, marketing copy, product announcement, advertisements, cover letters, and even negotiating with medical [insurance companies](https://twitter.com/StuartBlitz/status/1602834224284897282).

But we'll also need to reckon with the trade-offs of making insta-paragraphs and 1-click cover images. These new models are poised to flood the web with generic, generated content.

You thought the first page of Google was bunk before? You haven't seen Google where SEO optimizer bros pump out billions of perfectly coherent but predictably dull informational articles for every longtail keyword combination under the sun.

Marketers, influencers, and growth hackers will set up [OpenAI ‚Üí Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/openai/integrations) pipelines that auto-publish a relentless and impossibly banal stream of LinkedIn #MotivationMonday posts, ‚Äúengaging‚Äù tweet <span role="img">üßµ</span> threads, Facebook outrage monologues, and corporate blog posts.

It goes beyond text too: [video essays on YouTube](https://twitter.com/SamRo/status/1605919856808714240?s=20&t=QB-eYoISuymlqbHFFDnrWw), TikTok clips, podcasts, slide decks, and Instagram stories can all be generated by [patchworking](https://runwayml.com/) together ML systems. And then [regurgitated](https://byautomata.io/) for each medium.

We're about to drown in a sea of pedestrian takes. An explosion of noise that will drown out any signal. Goodbye to finding original human insights or authentic connections under that pile of cruft.

Many people will say we already live in this reality. We've already become skilled at sifting through unhelpful piles of ‚Äúoptimised content‚Äù designed to gather clicks and advertising impressions.

4chan proposed [dead internet theory](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/08/dead-internet-theory-wrong-but-feels-true/619937/) years ago: that most of the internet is ‚Äúempty and devoid of people‚Äù and has been taken over by artificial intelligence. A milder version of this theory is simply that we're overrun [with bots](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/12/how-much-of-the-internet-is-fake.html). Most of us take that for granted at this point.

But I think the sheer volume and scale of what's coming will be meaningfully different. And I think we're unprepared. Or at least, I am.
