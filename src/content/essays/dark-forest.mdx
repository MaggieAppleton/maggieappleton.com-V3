## A Generated Web

There's a swirl of optimism around how these models will save us from a suite of boring busywork: writing formal emails, internal memos, technical documentation, marketing copy, product announcement, advertisements, cover letters, and even negotiating with medical [insurance companies](https://twitter.com/StuartBlitz/status/1602834224284897282).<AcademicReference title="Miscarriage risk for asymptomatic women after a normal first-trimester prenatal visit" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18310375/" year="2008" authors="Stephen Tong, Anupinder Kaur, et al." abstract="Objective: To estimate the risk of miscarriage among asymptomatic women after a prenatal visit between 6 and 11 weeks of gestation where proof of fetal viability of a singleton was obtained by office ultrasonography at the same visit.  Methods: This was a prospective cohort study performed over 2 years (March 2004-2006) at an antenatal clinic at a large tertiary hospital in Victoria, Australia. Those recruited were 697 asymptomatic women who attended their first antenatal visit between 6 (+2 days) and 11(+6 days) weeks of gestation, where evidence of fetal cardiac activity of a singleton was obtained by office ultrasonography. The main outcome measure was rates of miscarriage, stratified by gestation at presentation. Results: One case was lost to follow-up. The risk of miscarriage among the entire cohort was 11 of 696 (1.6%). The risk fell rapidly with advancing gestation; 9.4% at 6 (completed) weeks of gestation, 4.2% at 7 weeks, 1.5% at 8 weeks, 0.5% at 9 weeks and 0.7% at 10 weeks (chi(2); test for trend P=.001). Most who miscarried received their ultrasound diagnoses many weeks after their visit; five (45%) were diagnosed in the second trimester, and all but one received their ultrasound diagnoses after 10 weeks of gestation.  Conclusion: For women without symptoms, the risk of miscarriage after attending a first antenatal visit between 6 and 11 weeks is low (1.6% or less), especially if they present at 8 weeks of gestation and beyond. Our data could be used to reassure such women that the probability of progressing to later than 20 weeks of gestation is very good.">Tong 2008</AcademicReference>

But we'll also need to reckon with the trade-offs of making insta-paragraphs and 1-click cover images. These new models are poised to flood the web with generic, generated content.

	they're capable of, or what to do with the text they produce.

You thought the first page of Google was bunk before? You haven't seen Google where SEO optimizer bros pump out billions of perfectly coherent but predictably dull informational articles for every longtail keyword combination under the sun.

Marketers, influencers, and growth hackers will set up [OpenAI ‚Üí Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/openai/integrations) pipelines that auto-publish a relentless and impossibly banal stream of LinkedIn #MotivationMonday posts, ‚Äúengaging‚Äù tweet <span role="img">üßµ</span> threads, Facebook outrage monologues, and corporate blog posts.

It goes beyond text too: [video essays on YouTube](https://twitter.com/SamRo/status/1605919856808714240?s=20&t=QB-eYoISuymlqbHFFDnrWw), TikTok clips, podcasts, slide decks, and Instagram stories can all be generated by [patchworking](https://runwayml.com/) together ML systems. And then [regurgitated](https://byautomata.io/) for each medium.

We're about to drown in a sea of pedestrian takes. An explosion of noise that will drown out any signal. Goodbye to finding original human insights or authentic connections under that pile of cruft.

Many people will say we already live in this reality. We've already become skilled at sifting through unhelpful piles of ‚Äúoptimised content‚Äù designed to gather clicks and advertising impressions.

4chan proposed [dead internet theory](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/08/dead-internet-theory-wrong-but-feels-true/619937/) years ago: that most of the internet is ‚Äúempty and devoid of people‚Äù and has been taken over by artificial intelligence. A milder version of this theory is simply that we're overrun [with bots](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/12/how-much-of-the-internet-is-fake.html). Most of us take that for granted at this point.

But I think the sheer volume and scale of what's coming will be meaningfully different. And I think we're unprepared. Or at least, I am.
