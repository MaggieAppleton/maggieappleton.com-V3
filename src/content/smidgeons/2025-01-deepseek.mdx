If you're not distressingly embedded in the torrent of AI news on Twixxer like I reluctantly am, you might not know what [DeepSeek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepSeek) is yet. Bless you.

From what I've gathered:

- On January 20th, a Chinese company named DeepSeek released a new reasoning model called R1.
- DeepSeek R1 is [open-source](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1/tree/main), meaning you can download it and run it on your own machine. They also offer [API access](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/).
- Reaches equal or better performance on a number of major benchmarks compared to OpenAI's o1 and Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 3.5 but is significantly cheaper to use. DeepSeek claims it only cost $5.5 million to train the model, compared to an [estimated $41-78 million](https://www.forbes.com/sites/katharinabuchholz/2024/08/23/the-extreme-cost-of-training-ai-models/) for GPT-4.
- You can use R1 online through the DeepSeek [chat interface](https://chat.deepseek.com/). You can turn on both reasoning and web search to inform your answers. Reasoning mode shows you the model “thinking out loud” before returning the final answer.

- The thoughtbois of Twixxer are winding themselves into knots trying to theorise what this means for the U.S.-China AI arms race. A few people have referred to this as a “[sputnik moment](https://www.exponentialview.co/p/the-year-end-wake-up-the-chinese).”
- From my initial, unscientific, unsystematic explorations with it, it's _really_ good. Using it as my default LM going forward.

Here's the announcement Tweet:

**TLDR** high-quality reasoning models are getting significantly cheaper and more open-source. This means companies like Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic won't be able to maintain a monopoly on access to fast, cheap, good quality reasoning. This is net good for everyone.
