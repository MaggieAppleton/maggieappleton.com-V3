[Unbaited](https://unbaited.danielpetho.com/) is a browser extension that filters out engagement bait from your feed on Twixxer. Uses Llama 3.3 under the hood to analyse Tweets in real time and then blurs out sensationalist political content. Or whatever else you prompt it to blur â€“ the system prompt is editable.

This is certainly _a way_ to try and manage Twixxer's slow demise into right-wing extremist content. Though I'm taking this more as a thought experiment and interesting prototype than a sincere suggestion we should spend precious energy burning GPUs on clickbait filtering.
