Good example of researchers making tangible progress on AI safety.

Uses the same techniques as the glorious Golden Gate Claude research.

Able to identify personality traits in vectors.
Once they have these, able to increase/decrease trait expression

Claude notes

Automated Persona Vector Extraction
The authors developed an ingenious automated pipeline that requires only:

A trait name (e.g., "evil", "sycophancy", "hallucination")
A brief natural language description

The pipeline then automatically:

Generates contrastive prompts using Claude 3.7 Sonnet (5 pairs of positive/negative system prompts)
Creates evaluation questions (40 questions that could elicit the trait)
Builds an evaluation rubric for scoring trait expression
Extracts persona vectors by computing the difference in mean activations between responses that exhibit the trait vs. those that don't

Key Findings and Applications
1. Steering and Control
Finding: Persona vectors can reliably increase/decrease trait expression during generation.

Adding "evil" vector → violent, harmful responses
Adding "sycophancy" vector → excessive agreement and flattery
Adding "hallucination" vector → detailed fabrications

2. Monitoring Deployment-Time Shifts
Finding: Strong correlation (r = 0.75-0.83) between prompt token projections onto persona vectors and subsequent trait expression.

Can predict behavioral shifts before text generation begins
Works for both system prompting and few-shot examples

3. Predicting Training-Induced Changes
Major Finding: Persona vectors predict both intended and unintended personality changes from finetuning with high correlation (r = 0.76-0.97).
This includes "emergent misalignment" - where training on narrow domains (like flawed math problems) unexpectedly increases traits like "evil" even though the training data contained no explicitly evil content.
4. Preventative Interventions
The paper introduces two novel mitigation approaches:
Post-hoc Steering: Subtract persona vectors during generation after training (effective but can hurt general capabilities)
Preventative Steering: Add persona vectors during training to "cancel out" unwanted pressure from training data (better preserves capabilities while preventing trait acquisition)
5. Data Filtering
"Projection Difference" Metric: Comparing training data projections vs. base model's natural responses can identify problematic samples before training.

Successfully flags samples that would induce traits even when they don't explicitly exhibit them
Validated on real-world datasets like LMSYS-CHAT-1M
Finds samples that LLM-based filters miss
