Welcome to the smidgeon stream. This is a new kind of content on the [Garden](/garden). One that was overdue. They're called _smidgeons_. Teeny, tiny entries. The kinds of things I used to put in Tweets, before Twitter died a terrible death.

They may only be a single sentence long. Links to interesting things. Things I learned today. I've been meaning to do this for a while, but a recent migration to [Astro](https://astro.build/) suddenly made it much easier.
