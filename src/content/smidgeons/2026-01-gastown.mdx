Steve Yegge just published an [elaborate manifesto](https://steve-yegge.medium.com/welcome-to-gas-town-4f25ee16dd04) about Gastown, his Mad Max-themed agent orchestrator that runs dozens of coding agents simultaneously. It's entirely vibecoded, thoughtlessly designed with off-the-cuff solutions, and inefficiently burning through (tens of?) thousands of dollars a month in API costs.

I think it's both utterly unhinged and important to take seriously in the conversation about how agents will change the nature of software development.

Not because it's a serious, working development tool (it isn't). But because it's a good piece of speculative design fiction that asks provocative questions and reveals the shape of constraints we'll face as agentic coding systems mature and grow.

I also think Yegge deserves some praise for exercising the agency to take a swing at a system like this, despite the inefficiencies and chaos of this iteration. And then running a public tour of his shitty, quarter-built plane while it's mid-flight.

When I was taken to the Tate Modern as a child I'd point at Mark Rothko pieces and say to my mother "I could do that", and she would say "yes, but you didn't."

Many people have talked about what large-scale, automated agent orchestration systems _could_ look like in a few years, and no one else attempted to sincerely build it. Points to Yegge.

I should be clear have not used Gastown. Yegge emphatically told me not to. Multiple times, in increasingly threatening typography. I trust his guidance on his own slush pile.

[quote from the piece]

But here's what stood out to me from the parts of the manifesto I could comprehend:

**1. Design and planning becomes the bottleneck when you hand all production code over to agentic systems.**

There's an irony here: automating code execution reveals design and planning as the non-automatable bottleneck. As Yegge puts it: "Gas Town churns through implementation plans so quickly that you have to do a LOT of design and planning to keep the engine fed."

When 20-30 AI agents can execute code faster than you can specify what to build, the developer role fundamentally shifts. Yegge describes it explicitly: you become "a Product Manager, and Gas Town is an Idea Compiler. You just make up features, design them, file the implementation plans, and then sling the work around."

The entire MEOW stack (Molecular Expression of Work) exists to solve this planning bottleneck. Workflows must be pre-designed as "formulas" (workflow templates in TOML), which get "cooked" into "protomolecules" (instantiable workflow graphs), which become "molecules" (actual work sequences) that agents execute step-by-step. Yegge's even building a "Mol Mall"—a marketplace for pre-packaged workflow templates—to help scale the supply of designed work.

Your job becomes: think → design → template → multiply. The implementation? That's just execution.

**2. The system is "expensive as hell" but the economics still might make sense**

Yegge describes Gastown as "expensive as hell" and warns "you won't like Gas Town if you ever have to think, even for a moment, about where money comes from." He's already on his second Claude Code account and expects to need a third "by the end of next week."

Let's do some napkin math. Claude API accounts have spending limits around $5-10k per month. Running 20-30 agents continuously across 2-3 accounts suggests Gastown is burning somewhere in the **$10k-30k per month range** (though this is rough estimation given limited data).

That sounds absurd until you compare it to a US senior developer salary: $150k-200k per year works out to $12.5k-17k per month. If Gastown genuinely multiplies throughput by 5-10x, the cost per unit of valuable work starts to look competitive with human labor.

The current cost is artificially inflated by system inefficiency—work gets lost, bugs get fixed 2-3 times, designs go missing and need redoing. It's chaos. As models improve and orchestration patterns mature, costs should drop while output quality rises.

This isn't practical for indie developers. But for companies? The economics might already be defensible, and will only get better.

**3. Buried in the chaos are sketches of future agent orchestration patterns**

The terminology is overwhelming: polecats, deacons, dogs, Boot the dog, seancing, beads, epics, molecules, protomolecules, MEOW stack, convoys, patrols, wisps, hooks, GUPP. I got lost somewhere after the MEOW stack.

But if you step back and squint, these Mad Max-themed concepts point at underlying patterns that future agentic systems will likely need:

**Work Representation**: Atomic units that can be tracked, composed, and templated. Think of it like breaking a book into chapters, paragraphs, and sentences—work at different granularities. Some work is permanent (project features), some is ephemeral (coordination tasks). All of it lives in git as the source of truth.

**Agent Coordination**: Agents have persistent identities (like employees with names and job roles), while sessions are temporary (like work shifts). There's hierarchical supervision—a Mayor agent manages Witness agents who oversee Polecat worker agents. A Deacon agent coordinates Dog helper agents. Roles specialize: some implement, some merge, some troubleshoot, some maintain. Like a factory with foremen, line workers, quality control, and maintenance crews.

**Execution Patterns**: The GUPP principle (Gastown Universal Propulsion Principle) states: if work is assigned to your hook, you must do it. No waiting for human prompts. Work piles up in queues and gets processed. Patrol agents loop through checks with exponential backoff. The system achieves "nondeterministic idempotence"—work eventually completes even through crashes and chaos, because state is durable and agents can always resume.

**Infrastructure**: Git makes everything auditable and recoverable. A merge queue prevents conflicts when many agents work in parallel. Message passing coordinates between agents. The Refinery agent sequentially merges work to prevent the "monkey knife fight" that happens when 20 agents try to rebase simultaneously.

These patterns are messy and immature in Gastown. The system is held together with duct tape, tmux scripts, and vibe-coded chaos. But they hint at the fundamental primitives that cleaner, more general agent orchestration systems might be built from. Concepts that already exist in other domains (Kubernetes, Temporal, message queues) but haven't yet been properly adapted for agentic coding workflows.

**4. The code distance debate: how close do developers need to be?**

Yegge's positioned himself at the extreme end of the spectrum. Gastown is "100% vibe coded. I've never seen the code, and I never care to." He's written 225k lines of Go for Beads "in October. I've never looked at Beads either." In his 8-stage evolution chart of AI-assisted coding, he's at Stage 8 (Building your own orchestrator), where code becomes so distant that "diffs scroll by. You may or may not look at them."

This raises a crucial question: how close does code need to be in the next generation of developer tools?

The answer seems to depend on a constellation of factors:

**Technical factors**: Front-end vs backend makes a huge difference. Language is a poor medium for designing easing curves and aesthetic feelings—I always need to touch the CSS, and it's often faster to tweak directly than prompt. Visual and aesthetic work requires proximity. Meanwhile, Yegge's backend/infrastructure work may be genuinely more amenable to distance. Debugging complexity matters too: visual glitches need eyes on them, while stack traces can be delegated. Type systems help create distance by catching errors agents might miss.

**Contextual factors**: Stakes matter. Weekend projects can tolerate chaos and rework. Production systems serving millions of users cannot. Corporate software has compliance and regulatory requirements. Team coordination gets harder when no one is looking at the code. Greenfield projects are easier to vibe-code than complex brownfield codebases where you need to understand existing patterns.

**Personal factors**: Trust in agents builds through experience. Yegge's clearly reached a level of confidence most developers haven't. Tolerance for chaos and rework varies wildly—some people need precision, others optimize for speed. Cognitive preferences matter: are you a visual thinker who needs to see structure, or are you comfortable reasoning abstractly?

**Looking ahead (2-3 years)**: As models improve, trust will increase and tolerance for distance will grow. Backend and infrastructure work may shift dramatically toward distance. But some domains—UI/UX, creative coding, performance optimization—may remain proximity-dependent. New tools might bridge the gap: better visualization, semantic diffs, AI-assisted code review.

The "code close" vs "code distant" camps may correlate with domain specialization. Will we see a bifurcation into "design/product engineers" who stay close to the code, and "AI wranglers" who orchestrate from a distance?

For now, I'm in the code-must-be-close camp. But I'm watching carefully to see where the lines get drawn.

One of the projects within Github Next is agentic workers.

But it's worth paying attention to because it's revealing constraints and patterns that will matter as agentic coding systems mature. When you give agents the ability to write code at scale, design and planning become the bottleneck. Cost structures need to dramatically shift. Orchestration patterns—persistent identities, hierarchical supervision, work queues, merge management—are still being discovered through chaos. And the optimal distance between developers and code will likely stratify by domain and context.

Is Yegge's vision premature or prescient? Probably both. This is a useful rough draft of the future, not a production-ready blueprint. Even if Gastown itself doesn't survive, the problems it's wrestling with and the patterns it's stumbling toward will inform what comes next.

Someone has to build the messy, duct-taped prototypes so the rest of us can learn what not to do. Bless Yegge for being that someone, and for dragging us through a 25-page tour of his Mad Max-themed chaos factory.
