Here's some light context about me:

- Designer, mediocre dev, anthropologist
- Design engineer at a research and design agency called Normally. We do early-stage design and prototyping work. Mostly exploratory AI products and capabilities for larger companies.
- Enthusiastic about visual programming, EUP, metaphors.

Who here has heard the phrase “tools for thought”?

Considering this is a lecture series on tools for augmented thinking and you are mostly MIT people, I’m going to be talking to you as potential creators of tools for thought, even if you don’t know much about this specific phrase yet. I’ll get into it’s meaning and history in a minute.

I’m also going to assume a little more computer science background than most other places, but I’ll give you all links and citations to everything I mention at the end so you can look it up later.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-4.jpeg" >

Tools for thought is a few things

It’s first and foremost a philosophical dream with a long history. About what happens when you give humans really well designed tools that expand the kind of thoughts they’re able to think.

Second, in recent years, it’s become a gathering point.It unifies a number of otherwise disparate fields.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-5.jpeg" >

And most interestingly, over the last 5 years, it’s become a category of software in the spreadsheets of VC firms and a thing that they’re willing to throw cash at

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-6.jpeg" >

The recent hype around this phrase first starting building in 2019.

Around the time that two fairly well-known researchers - Andy Matuschak and Michael Neilson - wrote this very long, comprehensive essay on the history of tools for thought, which gave it lot of renewed interest.

In it they gave readers a sweep through a lot of major thinkers and events in computing history like Douglas Engelbart’s work and Alan Kay, and made a plea for more people to start exploring this space of computing systems that augment the human intellect.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-7.jpeg" >

Around the same time (2019) a new note taking app called Roam Research stared to gain traction and aligned itself with this phrase “tools for thought”.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-8.jpeg" >

It looked pretty ugly, and had terrible performance, but it did some things that _at the time_ seemed novel:

- Bidirectional links or backlinks
- Used an outliner format where each piece of content is a single node that can be linked to any other node and embedded anywhere else in the graph.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-9.jpeg" >

They also has this crazy graph view that showed you connections between all your notes
And the whole thing was multiplayer.

The founder were experimenting with what seemed like novel ways of interacting with hypertext (but you might recognise some of these are quite old). Had precedence in the 80s and 90s, particularly Ted Nelson’s work on Xanadu.

Roam was trying to resurface these. And they had a compelling goal: giving people better tools for developing ideas collaboratively and synthesising them. Trying to enable bottom-up thinking and emergence.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-10.jpeg">

Roam kicked off a bit of a note-taking hype cycle. Suddenly we got a bunch of new note-taking startups that all proclaimed to be new tools for thought

This is Muse - more canvas and drawing based

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-11.jpeg">

Anytype - more focused on structured data

Reflect promising you can “think better” with this. Even if they don’t use the phrase “tools for thought” directly, creators of these tools understood they were now supposed to be in the business of making people think better

Logseq promising increasing understanding

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-16.jpeg">

There’s a bunch more of these - all released within the last 5 years, with the exception of Notion.

The phrase now feels synonymous with these experimental note-taking apps.

All promising their features would lead to better thinking; better quality thoughts, better memory, and more emergent connections between topics

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-17.jpeg">

We also got an endless pile of influencers making YouTube videos teaching you how to use these apps and setup elaborate organisational systems

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-18.jpeg">

This surge in interested let to more funding. Betaworks hosted an accelerator for a dozen tools for thought companies in New York

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-20.jpeg">

Essentially, Tools for thought became an idea machine
Idea machines are a concept Nadia Asparouhova coined in an essay in 2022.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-19.jpeg">

This means an ideology with backed by raw, tangible resources. Meaning people, companies, software, and money. She used examples like effective altruism or Web3, but frankly I think the Catholic Church also counts.

They are ideas with power behind them. Something we can name and point at and gather resources around.

And I’m glad tools for thought has become a financially-backed, powerful movement, because it’s a worthwhile cause.

BUT, I think the current understanding of it has some limitations and needs some redirection.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-21.jpeg">

So here’s the big question this talk is asking.
What if we consider…

I’m coming at this from an anthropology and design perspective
And I’m very much part of the community of people using and building this kind of software. I was an early user of Roam. I know a lot of the people building these TFT companies, so I feel obliged to critically interrogate it a bit.

The term and the community around it has grown significant enough that we’re all walking around with a lot of assumptions about the meaning and mission of this phrase, and what kind of work it requires.

But thinking about different ways we might interpret this term could lead us down very different paths about what we choose to work on and choose to build

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-22.jpeg">

So one of the first critical questions we should ask is what does TFT have to do with computers?
The phrase itself implies nothing about computation or digital objects

It’s simply tools that helps humans think new kinds of thoughts

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-23.jpeg">

If we take that definition at face value, and try to come up with examples of TFT, we’d have to conclude most of them precede computing by thousands of years

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-26.jpeg">

All of these are pre-computational

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-27.jpeg">

Hindu-arabic numerals made accounting and record keeping possible.
Calculations could be stored, shared, and referenced
Enabled all bureaucracy since.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-28.jpeg">

We’ve used poetry and song to extend memory and pass stories between generations before written language

Bards used rhetorical techniques and metric rhythm to make the stories easy to recite.

It’s how pieces like the Epic of Gilgamesh and the Mahabrata survived long enough to eventually be written down

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-29.jpeg">

Maps enabled humans to mentally navigate space differently - gave us allocentric views vs. egocentric.

We're able to construct mental models of much larger spaces that we can't directly see

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-30.jpeg">

Cartesian coordinates; famously developed by Rene Descartes after watching a fly circle around his room

Made us able to describe points in space with specific numbers.
Allows us to model objects that don’t exist with accuracy.
Allows us to precisely map and refer to points on the earth. Led to GPS.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-31.jpeg">

Zettelkasten (slip box)
A technique from around the 18th century where you write atomic notes on individual index cards and keep them all in a large box or “slip box”.
You assign each card an ID, and use those to link cards together to create deeply interconnected ideas.

Pre-cursor to deeply linked content we have with hyperlinking.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-32.jpeg">

But this is primarily a list of cultural practices and systems; they are techniques – a way of doing things - that enable us to relate to information and representation in new ways. Thus enabling new kinds of thoughts.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-33.jpeg">

They aren’t technological objects like hammers or compasses. They’re practices that people developed and passed down to one another through culture.

Most of the things we’re all enamoured with in the current software moment around tools for thought are actually the practices we do inside the new tools, rather than the tools themselves

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-34.jpeg">

Most of the YouTube thought leaders turn out to be teaching specific practices – like building a Zettelkasten – rather than teaching us specific software.

And it’s unclear how much enabling the software is doing vs. the cultural practice

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-35.jpeg">

The same goes for spaced repetition - there are guides on how to do it in every platform imaginable.

But we can’t quite tell if the app or the practice is what’s enabling people to improve their memory

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-36.jpeg">

So we’re in an interesting place; all this software is being called tools for thought
And most of the community is focused on building more software

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-37.jpeg">

But it seems like these cultural practices are the real tools for thought

What we’re exploring with here is the relationship between the computer as a medium and the cultural practices we do within the medium. And which one of those we should be focusing on…

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/tft-talk/TFT-V6-38.jpeg">

So we’re still on this question. What does any of this have to do with computers?

To understand why we’re confused it’s worth going back to the origins of the phrase and the people who proposed we should start paying attention to the idea.
