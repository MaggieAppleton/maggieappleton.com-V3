# Writing Assist decisions

## 2026-09-26 · 00 foundation · Default text generator

Maggie asked for OpenAI `gpt-6-sol` as Writing Assist's default text generator. The debug tool therefore uses OpenAI `gpt-6-sol` instead of the Anthropic Haiku model shown in the approved foundation config. `OPENAI_MODEL` can override the model, and the OpenAI provider is available when its API key is set. The Anthropic adapter remains available for tools that select it. This changes the default provider and model; the interface and tool behaviour stay as specified.
